This project was built as part of my journey through The Odin Project.
The primary goal of this project is to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
due to the Warining (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) the eval() function or any other solution that suggest returning a new Function() that evaluates a string should not be used.
In https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_direct_eval! , there is a good explanation why these function shouldn't be used, 
and because it is used in this project so it dosen't count.
I chose to focus more on CSS design and layout practice to sharpen my styling skills.
**Lessons Learned** 

1.Improved understanding of layout techniques using Flexbox and Grid.
2.Experimented with CSS transitions and animations.
3.Practiced CSS specificity and modularity.

**Future Improvements**

*Refactor JavaScript logic to align more closely with best practices.
